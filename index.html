        <p class="lead mb-5">This is a survey conducted on May 21st through May 24th of 2020 to evaluate the costs and benefits of various online learning platforms. The goal of this survey was to identify any gaps in the current online course offerings.</p>

        <h1 class="mb-5 text-secondary">Summary</h2>
        <h2 class="mb-3">Methodology</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          There are only a few leading platforms that offer online courses for children, particularly live and/or interactive courses. For this survey, the 8 most frequent platforms appearing in Google search results were examined. Each platform's website and course offerings were evaluated, and additional reviews from external sites were used to find information about the quality, size, and cost of courses. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="mb-3">The Main Takeaways</h2>
        <br>
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">Parents are excited about live classes in which their children can interact with other people.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>Recent reviews and articles about different platforms with live classes have an overwhelmingly positive view of live classes. </li>
            <li>Live classes and camps can require less supervision than other activities while allowing children to have social interaction with people other than their families.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">There is already an abundance of content on each platform, but niche topics are very popular.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>Outschool alone has 10,000 classes - it seems like every topic a kid might want to learn about is covered.</li>
            <li>The classes that parents raved most about in reviews were specific and unique, like “Python programming using examples from Harry Potter”.
            </li>
          </ul>    
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">3rd party learning platforms take a substantial cut of class profits.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>Outschool collects a 30% service fee from all paid enrollments, and KidPass collects a 25% platform fee from all paid enrollments conducted through the KidPass Digital Platform. Other platforms are less direct about their fees. </li>
            <li>The fee may be worth it: hosting courses with a commonly-used 3rd party platform can make enrollment less confusing for users, make payments simpler and appear safer, and any technology issues that students have can be directed to the 3rd party rather than educators.</li>
            <li>The same services could be implemented without using these platforms (most platforms just use Zoom), but it would require more technical overhead and families might be more comfortable using a trusted 3rd party.</li>
          </ul>    
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">Outschool appears to be the most popular platform for live, online classes.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>Other less popular platforms are part of a subscription system, have unreliable reviews, or offer classes that are not live and interactive.</li>
          </ul>    
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">Children’s museums do not appear to be using these platforms yet.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>Most workshops are taught by independent teachers, especially on Outschool and Kidpass.</li>
            <li>Some are taught by organizations such as summer camps, especially on ActivityHero and Care.com, but there appeared not to be any museums that offered courses or camps on any of the platforms reviewed.
            </li>
          </ul>    
          <div class="h3 mb-3 text-primary">Some platforms do not offer live classes but allow kids to engage in different ways.</div>
          <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>DIY is a website that has video workshops and allows kids to engage with each other through their own posts and videos and share their creations. The platform is kept “kid-friendly” by moderators. </li>
            <li>Other platforms like Skillshare focus on project-based classes that do not have a live component but are still designed to be interactive.
            </li>
          </ul>  
          <h2 class="mb-3">Other Considerations</h2>
