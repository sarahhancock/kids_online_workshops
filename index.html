        <h1 class="mb-5 text-secondary">Summary</h2>
        <h2 class="mb-3">Methodology</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          A total of 37 children's museums were reviewed for this survey. Of these 37 museums, 29 were found to have some form of virtual programming. These museums were chosen from two sources: 
        </p>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>22 museums in California from the Wikipedia <a target="_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_children%27s_museums_in_the_United_States">list of children's museums.</a></li>
          <li>15 museums in the United States from a Parents.com <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.parents.com/fun/vacation/us-destinations/the-10-best-childrens-museums/"> list of the best children's museums.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "lead">
          These sources were chosen because the goal of this survey is to provide virtual programming insight for the Children's Creativity Museum (CCM) in San Francisco, so it made sense to look at similar museums (i.e. in California and "the best").
          For the museums that offered virtual programming, information about the content, educators involved, cost, and technology used were gathered from the museums' websites.
